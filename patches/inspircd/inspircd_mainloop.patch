When a client registers (ie. sends USER+NICK), InspIRCd does not
immediately answers with 001. Instead it waits for the next iteration
of the main loop to call `DoBackgroundUserStuff`.

However, this main loop executes only once a second. This is usually
fine, but makes irctest considerably slower, as irctest uses hundreds
of very short-lived connections.

This patch removes the frequency limitation of the main loop to make
InspIRCd more responsive.
